# CSS Flexbox Exercise Project

## Project Description
This is the second CSS Flexbox exercise from the DevQuest course by Dev em Dobro, adapted from Frontend Mentor challenges. The project utilizes HTML and CSS to create a responsive layout.

## Key Features
- CSS Flexbox-based layout
- Responsive design
- Component-based structure
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Project Notes
Looking back now, being further along in the course, I realize I could have used more semantic HTML tags in the code. This serves as a learning experience for future projects.
